*Learn about UCSD's expanded virtual private network (VPN) service, which lets you create protected connections to UCSD's network from remote locations*

___

The UCSD VPN creates a virtual private connection over public networks using encryption and other security checks to help protect against computer data transmission interception. It also helps ensure only authorized users can access campus networks. With VPN, network computing traffic between your remote machine (off-campus or wireless) and campus passes over a single, encrypted connection, and your remote machine has a UCSD IP address

**These services require VPN:**

+ Shared Network Drives

+ Cognos/Tableau

+ Remote Desktop to computers or VMs

+  Logistics Porta

+  TN3270 (IFIS/ISIS)

+  Library resources (requires 2-Step Secured - allthruucsd)

  The VPN service offers the ability to create department-specific pools, which can be used to control access to departmental resources. Contact your IT support staff for additional information on accessing or using pools for your department. If you do not have IT support staff, contact the ITS Service Desk

  To access a VPN pool, when logging in to the VPN, enter your username followed by "@" the pool name. For example, to access the ITS pool, enter "username@ITS"
